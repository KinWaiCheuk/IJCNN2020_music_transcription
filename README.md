# Complete Implementation for MusicNet in Pytorch 
## Introduction
It is the complemete implementation of for this [repository](https://github.com/jthickstun/thickstun2018invariances/) originally written in Tensorflow. Most of my codes are based on the [demonstration repository](https://github.com/jthickstun/pytorch_musicnet) by the same aurthor.
All the weights for different models are located inside the **weights/** folder except for the  	**translation_invariant_morelvl3.ipynb** model. The training and testing loss for each epoch can be found in the **result_dict/** folder.
For more details regrading the network architecture, please read the following 2 papers written by [John Thickstun](https://github.com/jthickstun/)
